    <h3><p>Steps</p></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Form the ground beef into patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add a little oil to the grill or skillet to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip them.</li>
        <li>Add cheese on top of each patty and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the cheese is melted and the burger is cooked to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the patty on the bottom bun, followed by lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and your choice of condiments.</li>
        <li>Top with the other half of the bun and get ready to serve immediately.</li>
    </ul>
